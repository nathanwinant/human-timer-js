HumanTimerJS
============

A simple timer for human-scale user events, written in vanilla JS.


Testing
-------
Tests are currently written in [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).
There are [several ways to install Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine#installation),
but to get started quickly from within the `human-timer-js` project:

    mkdir jasmine
    cd jasmine
    git clone https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine.git
    mv jasmine/dist/jasmine-standalone-2.2.0.zip .
    unzip jasmine-standalone-2.2.0.zip

It's up to you whether to leave the jasmine git repo lying around inside the jasmine directory.

You can then open [SpecRunner.html](SpecRunner.html) in your browser.
